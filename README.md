# Iris-Species-Data-Science-Analytics-Project
This project is a classic data science case study widely used in machine learning to understand fundamental classification techniques. The dataset contains morphological measurements of three Iris flower species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, totaling 150 entries with 5 features.

Leveraging Python and key data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project demonstrates the complete EDA workflow — including handling missing values (if any), detecting duplicates, generating statistical summaries, creating visualizations, and identifying relationships between features. The simplicity and structure of this dataset make it ideal for learning core data analysis concepts and visual pattern recognition.

Insights gained from this analysis can help learners build intuition on data preparation, species differentiation, and foundational classification models — making it a perfect starting point for those new to data science and machine learning.
